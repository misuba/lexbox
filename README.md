lexbox
======

A text-making and -connecting environment in progress

Currently, Lexbox is just a low-rent, web-based Scrivener in its design goals. Once we hit that target, we will start thinking about various hypertextier use cases.

Installing
======

- npm install, of course
- get a MongoDB db set up, get its URL
- edit config.json.example with at least your mongo URL (eventually also change the secret), save it as config.json
- node app.js
