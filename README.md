lexbox
======

A text-making and -connecting environment in progress

Currently, Lexbox is just a low-rent, web-based Scrivener in its design goals. Once we hit that target, we will start thinking about various hypertextier use cases.

There is no client-side JS so far, as I am committed to making this project 100% "darknet friendly" and thus fully functional without client-side code. I've recently started actually using the product myself for note-taking and organization, however, so I will probably soon get frustrated enough with the UX to add some basics.
